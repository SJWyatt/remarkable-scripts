# remarkable-scripts
A collection of scripts I find useful for interfacing with my remarkable. 

### find_notebooks.py
A python script to help in searching for notebooks. 
Returns file UUID and other information. Can be run directly on the Remarkable if python3 is installed. \
Basic usage: `find_notebook.py -n Notes -f ~/Documents/Remarkable/backup/xochitl/ -d` \
Run with `python find_notebook.py -h` for more detailed instructions.
