# remarkable-scripts
A collection of scripts I find useful for interfacing with my remarkable. 

### find_notebooks.py
A python script to help in searching for notebooks. 
Returns file UUID and other information. Can be run directly on the Remarkable if python3 is installed. \
Basic usage: `python3 find_notebook.py -n "Search String" -f <path-to-xochitl>/` \
Run with `python3 find_notebook.py --help` for more detailed instructions.
